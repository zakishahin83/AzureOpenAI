At its core, <b>LangChain</b> is a framework built around LLMs. We can use it for chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), summarization, and much more. The core idea of the library is that we can “chain” together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules: <b>LangChain</b> is a software development framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). Background. <b>LangChain</b> was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. <b>LangChain</b> is a standard interface through which you can interact with a variety of LLMs. Prompt templates; <b>LangChain</b> provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.
